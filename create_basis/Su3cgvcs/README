Installation
------------

After copying the file Su3cgvcs.tar.gz to the desired directory, the installation of the program is simply by executing the usual UNIX command (or other equivalents command)

    gzip -dc Su3cgvcs.tar.gz | tar -xvf -

and all the required files are put inside the directory Su3cgvcs.

There are two main programs distributed along with the article: 

    cgu3drv: a sample program to calculate SU(3) CG coefficients in the SU(2) bases,
    
    cgu3o3drv: a sample program to calculate SU(3) CG coefficients in the SO(3) bases.  
    
To install cgu3drv, one simply writes in the UNIX prompt

    make cgu3drv
    
and to install cgu3o3drv, one writes

    make cgu3o3drv
    

Executing the programs
----------------------

To execute the program interactively, one simply types

    cgu3drv
    
if s/he wants to evaluate the SU(3) CG coefficients in the SU(2) bases interactively.  A similar execution is done for the SO(3)-bases counterpart.

Along with the article, input and output samples for each program are also incorporated.  To produce the results given in the article for evaluating the SU(3) CG coefficients in the SU(2) bases, one types

    cgu3drv < insu2.txt > outsu2.txt
    
and for the SO(3)-bases counterpart

    cgu3o3drv < inso3.txt > outso3.txt


Incorporating the codes as subroutines
--------------------------------------

For practical applications, one normally incorporates the relevant subroutines for her/his applications.  Here is the correct sequence in putting the subroutines (please, consult the program drivers as the examples) in the Fortran-77 format.  If one wants to include the calculation of SU(3) CG coefficients only in the SU(2) bases, below are the main components.

C --- right after all variable, parameter, and dimension declarations
C     factorials and binomials are only called once.
      call readfact
      ...
      ...
      ...
      call cgu3hw()
      ...
      call cgu3()
      ...
    
For the SO(3)-bases counterpart only,

C --- right after all variable, parameter, and dimension declarations
C     factorials, binomials, I- and S- functions are only called once.
      call readfact
      call readtab
      ...
      ...
      ...
      call cgu3hw()
      ...
      call cgu3o3()
      ...

For incorporating both the SU(2) and SO(3)-bases,

C --- right after all variable, parameter, and dimension declarations
C     factorials, binomials, I- and S- functions are only called once.
      call readfact
      call readtab
      ...
      ...
      ...
      call cgu3hw()
      ...
      call cgu3()
      ...
      call cgu3o3()
      ...
