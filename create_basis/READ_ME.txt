create_cg_coefficients.py is a script designed to calculate Clebsch-Gordan coefficients needed in
the calculations of the IBM. The code calls a Fortran script in SU3cgvcs to do the calculations and saves the output in the basis folder

to run type "python create_cg_coefficients.py" and input the boson number.

Copy the results in the basis folder to the pyIBM folder, or change the path to save directly in the basis folder of pyIBM, to use the coefficients in calculations.
